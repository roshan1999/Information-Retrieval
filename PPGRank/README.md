# Pairwise Policy Gradient Algorithm Implementation
---

- The folder `PPGRank_crossvalid` performs Cross Validation for 5 folds.
- The optimal hyperparameter for alpha = 0.005.
- The paper specifies gamma to be fixed at 1 
- To test for specific fold with hyperparameters, use the code in the folder PPGRank_single where each the fold, dataset and the parameters can be passed as arguments.
